# GitHub PR Reviewer Automation

Create a cron automation that watches a GitHub repository for pull requests
with a review trigger label, starts an OpenHands review conversation once per
label event, and posts the AI review as a GitHub comment.
Windows PowerShell equivalents for the setup, packaging, upload, and API-check shell snippets are in `references/windows.md`.

The automation script is deterministic: PR discovery, label-event tracking,
state persistence, stale-result suppression, and GitHub comment posting are
handled in Python. The LLM is invoked only for the review itself.

---

## Prerequisites

### Required secret

Verify that the following secret is set in **OpenHands Settings -> Secrets**:

| Secret name | Token type | Minimum permissions |
|---|---|---|
| `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Classic PAT | `repo` for private repos or `public_repo` for public repos |
| `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Fine-grained PAT | Contents: Read, Metadata: Read, Pull requests: Read, Issues: Read and Write |

Check with:
```bash
curl -s https://api.github.com/user \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  | python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(d.get('login') or d.get('message'))"
```

If the token is missing or invalid, inform the user and stop.

---

## Setup Workflow

Follow these steps in order.

### Step 1 - Verify `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`

Run the `curl` check above.

- If absent: *"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN is not set. Please add it in
  OpenHands Settings -> Secrets."* Stop.
- If the API returns `{"message": "Bad credentials"}`: tell the user the
  token is invalid and ask them to update it. Stop.

### Step 2 - Collect repository

Ask: *"Which GitHub repository should be monitored?
(Format: `owner/repo`, e.g. `myorg/backend`)"*

Validate access:
```bash
curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  | python3 -c "
import json, sys
d = json.load(sys.stdin)
if 'message' in d:
    print('ERROR:', d['message'])
else:
    print(f\"Accessible. Private: {d.get('private')}. Permissions: {d.get('permissions')}\")
"
```

Record `REPO = "{owner}/{repo}"`.

### Step 3 - Collect trigger label

Ask: *"Which PR label should trigger a review?
(Press Enter for the default: `openhands-review`.)"*

Record the answer as `TRIGGER_LABEL`. If the label does not exist yet, tell the
user that GitHub will still record the event once the label is created and
applied to a PR.

The automation reviews a PR when it sees the latest matching `labeled` event for
that label. To request another review later, remove and re-apply the label.

### Step 4 - Collect review tone

Ask: *"What review tone should the reviewer use?
  1. Thorough (default) - comprehensive coverage of correctness, security, tests, style
  2. Concise - high-signal only, skips minor style feedback
  3. Friendly - constructive and encouraging
(Press Enter for Thorough, or type your choice or any custom style description)"*

Map the choice to `REVIEW_TONE`:

| Answer | `REVIEW_TONE` | `REVIEW_STYLE_INSTRUCTIONS` |
|---|---|---|
| 1 / Enter | `"thorough"` | `""` |
| 2 | `"concise"` | `""` |
| 3 | `"friendly"` | `""` |
| Custom text, e.g. `strict but kind` | `"thorough"` | the custom text verbatim |

### Step 5 - Collect cron schedule

Ask: *"How often should the automation poll for labeled PRs?
(Press Enter for the default: every 5 minutes.
Use a cron expression for a different interval, e.g. `0 * * * *` = hourly)"*

Default: `*/5 * * * *`.

Record as `CRON_SCHEDULE`.

### Step 6 - Generate the automation script

Read `scripts/main.py` from this skill's directory. Apply exactly five constant
substitutions near the top of the file:

| Placeholder | Replace with |
|---|---|
| `REPO = "owner/repo"` | `REPO = "{owner_repo}"` |
| `TRIGGER_LABEL = "openhands-review"` | `TRIGGER_LABEL = "{trigger_label}"` |
| `REVIEW_TONE = "thorough"` | `REVIEW_TONE = "{review_tone}"` |
| `REVIEW_STYLE_INSTRUCTIONS = ""` | `REVIEW_STYLE_INSTRUCTIONS = "{style_instructions}"` |
| `DEFAULT_OPENHANDS_URL = "http://localhost:8000"` | leave unchanged unless the user has a preference |

Use a safe string writer such as `json.dumps(value)` when inserting user-provided
repository names, labels, or style instructions into Python string literals.

Write the customized script to a temporary build directory:
```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/pr-reviewer-build
# write the customized main.py to /tmp/pr-reviewer-build/main.py
```

Validate syntax before packaging:
```bash
python3 -m py_compile /tmp/pr-reviewer-build/main.py && echo "Syntax OK"
```

Fix any syntax errors before proceeding.

### Step 7 - Package and upload

Determine the Automation backend URL and auth from the `<RUNTIME_SERVICES>`
block in your system context:
- **OPENHANDS_HOST**: the Automation backend `url_from_agent`
- **Auth**: `X-Session-API-Key: $OPENHANDS_AUTOMATION_API_KEY`

```bash
tar -czf /tmp/pr-reviewer.tar.gz -C /tmp/pr-reviewer-build .

TARBALL_PATH=$(curl -s -X POST \
  "${OPENHANDS_HOST}/api/automation/v1/uploads?name=github-pr-reviewer" \
  -H "X-Session-API-Key: $OPENHANDS_AUTOMATION_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/gzip" \
  --data-binary @/tmp/pr-reviewer.tar.gz \
  | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['tarball_path'])")

echo "Uploaded: $TARBALL_PATH"
```

### Step 8 - Register the automation

```bash
curl -s -X POST "${OPENHANDS_HOST}/api/automation/v1" \
  -H "X-Session-API-Key: $OPENHANDS_AUTOMATION_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"name\": \"GitHub PR Reviewer: {owner}/{repo} label {trigger_label}\",
    \"trigger\": {\"type\": \"cron\", \"schedule\": \"{cron_schedule}\"},
    \"tarball_path\": \"$TARBALL_PATH\",
    \"entrypoint\": \"python3 main.py\",
    \"timeout\": 300
  }" | python3 -m json.tool
```

Record the returned `id`.

### Step 9 - Confirm

Tell the user:

> ✅ **GitHub PR Reviewer** is running!
>
> - Automation ID: `{id}`
> - Repository: `{owner}/{repo}`
> - Trigger label: `{trigger_label}`
> - Review tone: `{tone}`
> - Polling schedule: `{cron_schedule}`
> - State file: `~/.openhands/workspaces/automation-state/github_pr_reviewer_label_event_{id}.json`
>
> Apply the `{trigger_label}` label to a pull request to queue a review. Each
> label event is processed once. To request another review, remove and re-apply
> the label.

## Runtime Behaviour (per poll)

Each cron run executes `main.py`, which:

1. Loads state from the JSON file (see `references/state-schema.md`).
2. Resolves and validates `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` and repository access.
3. Lists open PRs, newest-updated first.
4. For each open PR carrying `TRIGGER_LABEL`:
   - Refetches current PR metadata to avoid acting on stale list data.
   - Finds the latest matching GitHub `labeled` issue event.
   - Skips the event if it has already been tracked.
   - Starts an OpenHands conversation with a review prompt that includes PR
     metadata, the exact head SHA, label event details, and instructions to
     clone the repo, inspect PR discussion, review comments, changed files,
     diff, and surrounding code.
   - Posts an acknowledgement comment with the label event, head SHA, and
     conversation link.
   - Records the label-event review in state with `status: "active"`.
5. For each active review conversation:
   - Marks it closed without posting if the PR has closed or merged.
   - Suppresses stale results if the PR head SHA changed after the review was
     queued.
   - When the conversation reaches `idle`, `finished`, `error`, or `stuck`,
     posts the agent's final response as a GitHub comment and marks the review
     closed.
6. Saves state atomically and fires the completion callback.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Bot never queues reviews | Trigger label not present or no matching `labeled` event | Apply the configured label to the PR |
| "Bad credentials" in run logs | Token expired | Rotate and update `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` |
| 404 on repo access | Repo name wrong or no access | Re-check `owner/repo` and token permissions |
| Same PR not reviewed after new commits | Label event was already processed | Remove and re-apply the trigger label |
| Review result never posts | Conversation still running or stuck | Open the conversation link from the acknowledgement comment |
| Stale review suppressed | PR head SHA changed while the agent was reviewing | Re-apply the trigger label after the latest commit |
