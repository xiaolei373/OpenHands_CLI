# Custom Automation Reference

> **⚠️ Do NOT use this reference unless the user has explicitly requested a custom automation.** Always use the preset/prompt endpoint from the main SKILL.md first. If the preset approach cannot satisfy the requirement, explain the options to the user and let them decide.

This file contains detailed documentation for creating custom automations with user-provided code, uploads, and entrypoints.

**When to use custom automation (only if the user explicitly chooses this):**
- Full control over the automation code structure is needed
- Custom dependencies or a specific runtime are required
- The user has confirmed that the prompt preset does not meet their requirements

## Uploading a Tarball

Before creating a custom automation, you need to upload your code as a tarball. The upload endpoint streams directly to cloud storage with a **1MB size limit**.

### Create a Tarball

```bash
tar -czf automation.tar.gz -C /path/to/your/code .
```

### Tarball Structure

```
automation.tar.gz
├── main.py           # Your entrypoint script
├── setup.sh          # Optional: install dependencies before entrypoint runs
└── requirements.txt  # Optional: additional dependencies
```

### Validate Before Packaging

**Always validate syntax before creating the tarball.** This catches errors immediately and avoids uploading broken code that fails silently at runtime.

```bash
python3 -m py_compile main.py   # fails with a clear error on any syntax problem
bash -n setup.sh                 # validates shell syntax without executing
```

Fix any errors reported before proceeding to the next step.


### Upload the Tarball

First, determine the API host. Look for a `<HOST>` value in the system prompt. If present, use that URL. Otherwise, default to `https://app.all-hands.dev`.

Then upload:

```bash
curl -X POST "${OPENHANDS_HOST}/api/automation/v1/uploads?name=my-automation&description=Weekly%20report%20generator" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENHANDS_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/gzip" \
  --data-binary @automation.tar.gz
```

### Upload Response

```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "tarball_path": "oh-internal://uploads/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "size_bytes": 12345
}
```

**Important:** Save the `tarball_path` value - you'll need it when creating the automation.

### Upload Status Values

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `UPLOADING` | Upload in progress |
| `COMPLETED` | Upload successful, `tarball_path` is available |

## Creating an Automation

Once you have a tarball uploaded (or an external URL), create the automation:

```bash
curl -X POST "${OPENHANDS_HOST}/api/automation/v1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENHANDS_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Weekly Report Generator",
    "trigger": {
      "type": "cron",
      "schedule": "0 9 * * 1",

| `COMPLETED` | Run finished successfully |
| `FAILED` | Run failed, check `error_detail` |

---

## Writing Automation Code

### How Execution Works

When a run is triggered, the automation service uploads your tarball to the agent server, which unpacks it, runs `setup.sh` to install dependencies, then executes your entrypoint. Your script therefore runs **inside the agent server** — not in a separate process.

The agent server exposes an HTTP API (at `AGENT_SERVER_URL`) for managing conversations. A **conversation** is an AI agent interaction that can use tools: bash commands, file editing, web browsing, and so on. Your script uses the SDK's `OpenHandsCloudWorkspace` (pointing to `AGENT_SERVER_URL`) to start, monitor, and stop conversations running in that same agent server.

Key points:
- **Your script and its conversations share the same agent server.** There is no network hop to a remote service.
- **Conversations are asynchronous.** You can fire one and continue, fire several concurrently, or start none at all (e.g. if your script fetches external data and decides no action is needed).
- **The completion callback** is sent by `OpenHandsCloudWorkspace.__exit__` when the `with` block exits, telling the automation service the run is done. For async patterns, defer exiting until the conversation is in the desired state.
- **Secrets** stored in the agent server are accessed via its REST API: `GET {AGENT_SERVER_URL}/api/settings/secrets/{name}` with `X-Session-API-Key: {SESSION_API_KEY}`. SDK scripts can also call `workspace.get_llm()` to get the configured LLM.

**SDK Documentation:** https://docs.openhands.dev/sdk

### SDK-based Scripts

For scripts that start AI agent conversations, install the SDK packages in `setup.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Install uv for fast dependency management (recommended)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Install the OpenHands SDK packages from PyPI using uv
uv pip install -q openhands-sdk openhands-workspace openhands-tools
```

### Basic Automation Structure

```python
"""Example automation using the OpenHands SDK."""
import os

from openhands.sdk import Conversation
from openhands.tools.preset.default import get_default_agent
from openhands.workspace import OpenHandsCloudWorkspace

# AGENT_SERVER_URL is set by the automation service for the agent server URL.
# SESSION_API_KEY / OH_SESSION_API_KEYS_0 authenticate against that server.
api_key = os.environ.get("SESSION_API_KEY") or os.environ.get("OH_SESSION_API_KEYS_0", "")
api_url = os.environ.get("AGENT_SERVER_URL", "")

# OpenHandsCloudWorkspace connects back to the agent server to manage conversations.
# __exit__ sends the completion callback to the automation service.
with OpenHandsCloudWorkspace(
    local_agent_server_mode=True,
    cloud_api_url=api_url,
    cloud_api_key=api_key,
) as workspace:
    llm = workspace.get_llm()
    agent = get_default_agent(llm=llm, cli_mode=True)
    conversation = Conversation(agent=agent, workspace=workspace)
    conversation.send_message("Your automation prompt here")
    conversation.run()
    conversation.close()
# OpenHandsCloudWorkspace.__exit__ fires the completion callback here.
```

### Selecting an LLM profile

The automation service injects an `AUTOMATION_MODEL` environment variable holding the **LLM profile name** the automation should run with. This is the profile a user selects when editing the automation, or — when none is selected — a snapshot of the user's active profile taken when the automation was created. To honor it on every run, read `AUTOMATION_MODEL` and pass it to `workspace.get_llm(profile_name=...)`:

```python
# AUTOMATION_MODEL is the selected profile name (absent when none was chosen).
model_profile = os.environ.get("AUTOMATION_MODEL") or None
try:
    llm = workspace.get_llm(profile_name=model_profile)
except FileNotFoundError:
    # The profile was renamed or deleted after the automation was created;
    # fall back to the user's default LLM rather than failing the run.
    if not model_profile:
        raise
    print(f"profile {model_profile!r} not found; falling back to default profile")
    llm = workspace.get_llm()
```

Calling `workspace.get_llm()` with no `profile_name` always uses the user's default LLM. The built-in prompt and plugin presets already follow the pattern above; custom scripts should too so the selected profile is honored regardless of trigger type or execution backend.

### Conversation Persistence

Conversations started during a run remain accessible in the OpenHands UI after the run completes — users can view the history and continue interacting. By default, `Conversation` does not delete the conversation on close:

```python
# Default: conversation persists after close (users can view/continue it)
conversation = Conversation(agent=agent, workspace=workspace)

# Explicitly persist (same as default)
conversation = Conversation(agent=agent, workspace=workspace, delete_on_close=False)

# Delete conversation resources on close
conversation = Conversation(agent=agent, workspace=workspace, delete_on_close=True)
```

The agent server itself persists until it times out or is manually deleted; this is managed by the automation service, not by the workspace.

### Conversation Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Synchronous (run and wait)

The simplest pattern — start a conversation, block until it finishes, then exit (firing the callback).

```python
conversation.send_message("Analyze the latest deployment logs and summarise any errors")
conversation.run()   # blocks until the agent finishes or times out
conversation.close()
```

#### Pattern 2: Conditional (fetch data first, then decide)

A common pattern where the script queries an external source and only starts a conversation if needed.

```python
import httpx

response = httpx.get("https://api.example.com/alerts", headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"})
alerts = response.json().get("alerts", [])

if not alerts:
    print("No alerts — nothing to do.")
else:
    # Only now do we spin up an agent conversation
    with OpenHandsCloudWorkspace(local_agent_server_mode=True, cloud_api_url=api_url, cloud_api_key=api_key) as workspace:
        llm = workspace.get_llm()
        agent = get_default_agent(llm=llm, cli_mode=True)
        conversation = Conversation(agent=agent, workspace=workspace)
        conversation.send_message(f"Investigate these alerts and open GitHub issues: {alerts}")
        conversation.run()
        conversation.close()
```

#### Pattern 3: Wait for conversation completion (polling)

Start a conversation without blocking, do other work, then poll until the conversation reaches a terminal state before exiting. The callback fires only after the conversation is done.

`ConversationExecutionStatus.is_terminal()` returns `True` for `FINISHED`, `ERROR`, and `STUCK`. Call `refresh_from_server()` before checking status — `execution_status` uses a cached value and won't update automatically.

```python
import time
from openhands.sdk.conversation.state import ConversationExecutionStatus

with OpenHandsCloudWorkspace(local_agent_server_mode=True, cloud_api_url=api_url, cloud_api_key=api_key) as workspace:
    llm = workspace.get_llm()
    agent = get_default_agent(llm=llm, cli_mode=True)
    conversation = Conversation(agent=agent, workspace=workspace)
    conversation.send_message("Run a long analysis task")
    # Conversation is now running asynchronously in the agent server.

    # Do other work here while conversation runs...

    # Wait until the conversation reaches a terminal state.
    while True:
        time.sleep(5)
        conversation.refresh_from_server()
        if conversation.execution_status.is_terminal():
            break

    conversation.close()
# Callback fires here — after the conversation has finished.
```

#### Pattern 4: Deferred callback via stop hook

For cases where the automation script needs to exit while a conversation is still running, use a `stop` hook to fire the completion callback from within the agent server when the conversation finishes.

The `stop` hook runs a shell command when the agent stops. The agent server's environment includes `AUTOMATION_CALLBACK_URL`, `AUTOMATION_CALLBACK_API_KEY`, and `AUTOMATION_RUN_ID`, so the hook can call the automation service directly.

```python
from openhands.sdk.hooks import HookConfig, HookDefinition, HookMatcher

# Shell command that fires the completion callback when the agent stops.
# Runs inside the agent server — env vars are available at hook execution time.
stop_hook = HookConfig(
    stop=[
        HookMatcher(hooks=[
            HookDefinition(
                command=(
                    'curl -sf -X POST "$AUTOMATION_CALLBACK_URL" '
                    '-H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTOMATION_CALLBACK_API_KEY" '
                    '-H "Content-Type: application/json" '
                    '-d \'{"status":"COMPLETED","run_id":"$AUTOMATION_RUN_ID"}\' || true'
                )
            )
        ])
    ]
)

with OpenHandsCloudWorkspace(local_agent_server_mode=True, cloud_api_url=api_url, cloud_api_key=api_key) as workspace:
    llm = workspace.get_llm()
    agent = get_default_agent(llm=llm, cli_mode=True)
    conversation = Conversation(agent=agent, workspace=workspace, hook_config=stop_hook)
    conversation.send_message("Do some long-running work")
    # Don't call run() — the conversation runs asynchronously.
    # When the agent stops, the stop hook will fire the callback.
# OpenHandsCloudWorkspace.__exit__ also fires a callback here (on script exit).
# The automation service should handle receiving two callbacks for the same run.
```

> **Note:** When using the stop hook pattern, the automation service receives two completion callbacks — one from `OpenHandsCloudWorkspace.__exit__` when the script exits, and one from the stop hook when the conversation finishes. Ensure your automation service handles duplicate callbacks gracefully.

---

### Deterministic Script (No LLM)

For tasks that don't need AI reasoning — sending a Slack message, calling an API, rotating from a fixed list — skip the SDK entirely. Use pure Python stdlib with `python3 main.py` as the entrypoint and no `setup.sh`.

**Accessing secrets** — custom secrets are not injected into the subprocess environment automatically. Fetch them via the agent server's REST API:

```python
import os, urllib.request

def get_secret(name: str) -> str:
    url = os.environ.get("AGENT_SERVER_URL", "").rstrip("/")
    key = os.environ.get("SESSION_API_KEY") or os.environ.get("OH_SESSION_API_KEYS_0", "")
    req = urllib.request.Request(
        f"{url}/api/settings/secrets/{name}",
        headers={"X-Session-API-Key": key},
    )
    with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as r:
        return r.read().decode().strip()
```

**Firing the callback** — without the SDK, POST to `AUTOMATION_CALLBACK_URL` before exiting. If you never fire the callback the run stays `RUNNING` until the watchdog marks it `FAILED`.

```python
import json, os, urllib.request

def fire_callback(status: str = "COMPLETED", error: str | None = None) -> None:
    url = os.environ.get("AUTOMATION_CALLBACK_URL", "")
    if not url:
        return
    body = {"status": status, "run_id": os.environ.get("AUTOMATION_RUN_ID", "")}
    if error:
        body["error"] = error
    req = urllib.request.Request(url, data=json.dumps(body).encode(), headers={
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ.get('AUTOMATION_CALLBACK_API_KEY', '')}",
    })
    try:
        urllib.request.urlopen(req)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Callback error (non-fatal): {e}")
```

## State Persistence (KV Store)

Polling automations that run on a schedule need to remember state between runs — for example, the timestamp of the last processed event, or which conversation IDs are currently active. Storing this in a local file does not work on cloud deployments where each run may land on a fresh pod.

The automation service provides a built-in key-value store scoped per-automation. It is available in every run when the service is configured with `AUTOMATION_KV_SECRET`. Detect availability by checking for `AUTOMATION_KV_TOKEN` in the environment.

### KV Store API

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/v1/kv/{key}` | GET | Get value (404 if not found) |
| `/v1/kv/{key}` | PUT | Set value (201 on create, 200 on update) |
| `/v1/kv/{key}` | DELETE | Delete key |
| `/v1/kv/{key}/incr` | POST | Atomic integer increment |
| `/v1/kv/{key}/decr` | POST | Atomic integer decrement |
| `/v1/kv/{key}/rpush` | POST | Append item to a list |
| `/v1/kv/{key}/lpop` | POST | Pop item from front of a list |

**Authentication:** `Authorization: Bearer $AUTOMATION_KV_TOKEN`

**Base URL:** `$AUTOMATION_API_URL` (e.g., `https://app.all-hands.dev/api/automation`)

Values are arbitrary JSON (dict, list, number, string). All keys are isolated per-automation — different automations cannot access each other's data.

### KV Store Helpers

Copy these helpers into any deterministic script that needs state persistence:

```python
import json, os, urllib.error, urllib.request

_KV_TOKEN = os.environ.get("AUTOMATION_KV_TOKEN", "")
_KV_BASE = os.environ.get("AUTOMATION_API_URL", "").rstrip("/")


def kv_available() -> bool:
    """Return True when the KV store is reachable in this run."""
    return bool(_KV_TOKEN and _KV_BASE)


def kv_get(key: str):
    """Fetch a value from the KV store. Returns None if the key does not exist."""
    req = urllib.request.Request(
        f"{_KV_BASE}/v1/kv/{key}",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {_KV_TOKEN}"},
    )
    try:
        with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as r:
            return json.loads(r.read())["value"]
    except urllib.error.HTTPError as exc:
        if exc.code == 404:
            return None
        raise


def kv_set(key: str, value) -> None:
    """Write a value to the KV store."""
    req = urllib.request.Request(
        f"{_KV_BASE}/v1/kv/{key}",
        data=json.dumps(value).encode(),
        headers={
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {_KV_TOKEN}",
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
        method="PUT",
    )
    with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as r:
        r.read()
```

### Load / Save Pattern

For polling scripts that maintain a single state document, use a KV-first pattern with a local-file fallback so the script also works in local/dev environments where the KV store is not configured:

```python
import json, os, urllib.error, urllib.request
from pathlib import Path

_KV_TOKEN = os.environ.get("AUTOMATION_KV_TOKEN", "")
_KV_BASE = os.environ.get("AUTOMATION_API_URL", "").rstrip("/")
_STATE_KEY = "state"


def kv_available() -> bool:
    return bool(_KV_TOKEN and _KV_BASE)


def kv_get(key: str):
    req = urllib.request.Request(
        f"{_KV_BASE}/v1/kv/{key}",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {_KV_TOKEN}"},
    )
    try:
        with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as r:
            return json.loads(r.read())["value"]
    except urllib.error.HTTPError as exc:
        if exc.code == 404:
            return None
        raise


def kv_set(key: str, value) -> None:
    req = urllib.request.Request(
        f"{_KV_BASE}/v1/kv/{key}",
        data=json.dumps(value).encode(),
        headers={
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {_KV_TOKEN}",
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
        method="PUT",
    )
    with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as r:
        r.read()


def _state_file_path() -> Path:
    workspace = os.environ.get("WORKSPACE_BASE", "")
    if workspace:
        root = Path(workspace).resolve().parent.parent
    else:
        root = Path.home() / ".openhands" / "workspaces"
    state_dir = root / "automation-state"
    state_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    payload = json.loads(os.environ.get("AUTOMATION_EVENT_PAYLOAD", "{}"))
    automation_id = payload.get("automation_id", "default")
    return state_dir / f"my_poller_{automation_id}.json"


def _default_state() -> dict:
    return {"version": 1, "last_poll": None}


def load_state() -> dict:
    if kv_available():
        data = kv_get(_STATE_KEY)
        if data is not None:
            print("State loaded from KV store")
            return data
        return _default_state()
    path = _state_file_path()
    if path.exists():
        try:
            return json.loads(path.read_text())
        except Exception as exc:
            print(f"Warning: state file unreadable ({exc}); starting fresh")
    return _default_state()


def save_state(state: dict) -> None:
    if kv_available():
        kv_set(_STATE_KEY, state)
        print("State saved to KV store")
        return
    path = _state_file_path()
    tmp = path.with_suffix(".tmp")
    tmp.write_text(json.dumps(state, indent=2))
    tmp.replace(path)
    print(f"State saved to {path}")
```

> **Why a single document?** The KV store uses a single-document model under the hood (all keys for an automation share one encrypted row). Storing your entire state under a single key like `"state"` is the most efficient pattern — it avoids multiple round-trips and ensures atomic reads and writes.

## Environment Variables

The automation service injects these environment variables into every run:

| Variable | Alt name | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `AGENT_SERVER_URL` | — | Agent server URL. Used as `cloud_api_url` for `OpenHandsCloudWorkspace`, and as the base URL for secret lookups |
| `OH_SESSION_API_KEYS_0` | `SESSION_API_KEY` | Session API key. Used as `cloud_api_key` for `OpenHandsCloudWorkspace`, and as `X-Session-API-Key` for REST API calls |
| `AUTOMATION_CALLBACK_URL` | — | POST here to mark the run complete (done automatically by `OpenHandsCloudWorkspace.__exit__`, or manually in no-LLM scripts) |
| `AUTOMATION_CALLBACK_API_KEY` | — | Bearer token for the completion callback POST |
| `AUTOMATION_RUN_ID` | — | Run ID to include in the completion callback payload |
| `AUTOMATION_EVENT_PAYLOAD` | — | JSON with trigger context: `automation_id`, `automation_name`, `trigger` type, and (for webhook runs) the raw event payload |
| `AUTOMATION_API_URL` | — | Base URL of the automation service (e.g., `https://app.all-hands.dev/api/automation`). Used to reach the KV store API |
| `AUTOMATION_KV_TOKEN` | — | Bearer token for the KV store API. Present whenever the service has `AUTOMATION_KV_SECRET` configured. Check for this variable to detect KV availability |

> **Note:** The session API key has two names: `SESSION_API_KEY` (cloud) and `OH_SESSION_API_KEYS_0` (local/dev). Always read both — see the code examples above.

## Troubleshooting

### Upload Failed: File too large
The upload limit is 1MB. Reduce your tarball size by:
- Excluding unnecessary files
- Not including `node_modules`, `.venv`, or other dependency directories

### Automation Not Running
1. Check if the automation is enabled (`enabled: true`)
2. Verify the cron schedule is correct
3. Check for validation errors in the response

### Run fails instantly with `error_detail: null`
The script sent `fire_callback("FAILED")` immediately — before doing meaningful work. Common causes:
- A required secret was empty: the `get_secret()` call failed or returned nothing
- A missing/wrong `AGENT_SERVER_URL` or `SESSION_API_KEY`
- An import error in the entrypoint

Add `"error": str(exc)` to your `fire_callback("FAILED", ...)` call so `error_detail` is populated.

### Run stays `RUNNING` indefinitely, then fails
The completion callback was never fired. Every code path in your script must call `fire_callback()` — including exception handlers.
